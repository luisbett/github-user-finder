## About

This was my first project built using React JS + TypeScript, and the objective was to study and familiarize myself with this framework.

I wanted to build an application using the GitHub API because it's free and there are many resources showing how to use it and handle the returned information.

In this project, I used the packages:

* [**react-icons**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) for the icons in the project;

I learned a lot about the React infrastructure and how it works.

I chose to use Vite to minimize the initial setup and invest more time in working on the project's business logic.
